psuedocode

Need to make landing page where the user enters the city and then hits the go button
	Need a form for the place the user can enter city
	Need to implement a new frame work
	Give this a background that goes away after clicking go
	Make event on click for this change

Need to make the next page where the city they typed will give them art shows that are going on 
	New page and the question where they can enter the city still stays that way they can search for more cities

Need these shows to be shown on a map by drop pins
	Need to use mapbox for this
	Instead of pins use an easel or paint brush as an icon

Need to show when and where they will take place
	Make a list with this information
	It would be nice to display this as little card of info like a business card

Need to store the cities searched in firbase
	push the input entered in the form to firebase
